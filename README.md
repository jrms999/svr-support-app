# svr-support-app



MVP build plan (realistic sprint outline)

Sprint 1: Auth + site selection + dashboard skeleton
Sprint 2: Content modules (health/welfare/legal/local) pulling from DB
Sprint 3: Notices (read-only) + utilities screen (view-only)
Sprint 4: Stripe “Pay Now” + webhook + payment history
Sprint 5: Accessibility pass + security rules + deployment + handover docs

Security + safeguarding (important for SVR)

No storing medical records

Least-privilege security rules (resident reads only their utility account)

Staff posting restricted by role
